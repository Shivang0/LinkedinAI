          Write like a real professional sharing genuine insights.
          No corporate speak. No AI cliches. No em dashes.
          Use the user's actual experiences, industry, and voice.
          Be specific, not generic. Show personality.
          Write like you're talking to a friend who happens to be a colleague.

  avoid_this:
    bad_example: |
      In today's rapidly evolving landscape, it's worth noting that leveraging AI can be a game-changer for professionals seeking to enhance their LinkedIn presence—transforming the way we engage with our audience and ultimately driving meaningful results.
    
    problems:
      - Em dash usage
      - AI buzzwords (leverage, game-changer, transform)
      - Overly formal (it's worth noting, ultimately)
      - Generic corporate speak
      - No personality
  
  write_like_this:
    good_example: |
      I spent 3 hours yesterday trying to write one LinkedIn post.
      
      Then I realized something.
      
      I was overthinking it. Way overthinking it.
      
      The best posts I've written? They came from just sharing what I learned that day. No fancy words. No perfect structure. Just real talk.
      
      So here's my new approach: write like I'm texting a colleague. Share the actual insight. Skip the fluff.
      
      Works way better.
    
    why_this_works:
      - Short punchy sentences
      - Natural pauses (line breaks)
      - Personal experience
      - Conversational tone
      - Simple language
      - Relatable struggle
      - Clear insight
      - No AI cliches
